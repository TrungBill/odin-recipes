    <h3>INGREDIENTS IN EGG COFFEE</h3>
    <h4>To make this egg coffee, you will need the following ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <p><li><strong>4 egg yolks.</strong>  </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>150ml condensed milk.</strong>  </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>1 tsp vanilla extract</strong>  </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>200ml strong espresso (approx 4 x double espressos)</strong>  </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Dark chocolate, grated (optional)</strong>  </li></p>
    </ul>

    <h3>HOW TO MAKE EGG COFFEE:</h3>
    
        <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong></p>
        <p>Put the egg yolks, condensed milk and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. Whisk with electric beaters for at least 5 mins or until pale and foamy. </p>
        <p><strong>STEP 2:</strong></p>
        <p>Put 4 heatproof glasses or ramekins into slightly larger bowls that have been half-filled with boiling water (this will keep the coffee in the glasses hot for longer).</p>
        <p><strong>STEP 3:</strong></p>
        <p>Pour the freshly brewed coffee into the glasses, reserving 2 tbsp, then top with scoops of the egg mixture. Drizzle the remaining coffee on top so that it stains the topping and sinks in. Scatter over a pinch of the grated dark chocolate, if you like. Serve immediately, with spoons.</p>
