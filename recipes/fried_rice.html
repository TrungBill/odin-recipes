    <h3>INGREDIENTS IN SEAFOOD FRIED RICE</h3>

    <ul>
        <p><li><strong>vegetable oil</strong> - necessary for stir-frying. </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>tiger prawns</strong> - I love fresh tiger prawns in this dish, but this can be substituted easily with any kind of shrimp. </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>eggs</strong> - fried rice staple. </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>white rice</strong> - freshly cooked is best, but you can use leftover rice. You will just need to add some water to soften the rice. </li></p>
        <p>li><strong>vegetables</strong> - fresh or frozen carrots, green peas, and sweet corn. You can get creative and add in whatever vegetables you have on hand. Green beans would go really well in this. </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>seasonings</strong> - sesame oil, maggi sauce, salt. Maggi sauce can be substituted with soy sauce. </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>satay sauce</strong>  </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>green onions</strong> - can be substituted with cilantro (but if using cilantro, it must be added at the end as a topping, as it will wilt under the heat). </li></p>
        <p><li><strong>roasted white sesame seeds (optional)</strong> - for topping. </li></p>
    </ul>
